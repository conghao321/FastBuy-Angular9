# FastBuy: Items Search Application(eBay Section)

#### A web application can enable users search items details and fetch items' cards from eBay API and others.

Developed it by TypeScript, Javascript and Python.

It uses some popular web development frameworks, including Angular, Bootstrap

It also provides a back-end application based on NodeJs and Flask to process Http requests and Ajax calls

This is a full REST application

#### <font color='red'> All the image assests, including pictures, logo, and icons,  belong to ebay, and all resources are only allowed to used by studying purpose, never bussniess. </font>

#### Server Side (NodeJS and Flask)

Both the express and flask are convenient and light backend frameworks. So in this project, I choose both of them to process all back-end behaviors, such as Ajax calls from front-end, sending request to eBay Api servers and tackle the json data, etc.

The default version of backend is performed by NodeJs, but you can also choose to use the flask version.

## Quick Start

#### 1. dependencies:

##### Angular 9

##### Node Js:

​ cors

got

##### Flask:

​ request module

#### 2. Quick Start:

a. Download the codes and install all the dependencies above mentioned.

##### b. Basic knowledge regarding Angular is required

c. Try it !

## Deployment on GCP

The backend is actually deployed on google cloud platform (GCP)

So, every one can simply uses my app.ysml file to deploy the app.js to the GCP.
